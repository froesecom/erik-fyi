# erik.fyi
Derp. My personal website. [erik.fyi](http://erik.fyi)

Uses Jekyll and jQuery. Other than that, pretty vanilla.

## TODO
- figure out how to deploy to github pages using Jekyll
- clean up this layout mess, and get pages working with their own layout
- write up a quick about page
- get about in nav
- add some fireballs already
- minify assets
- add open graph image for sharing
- optimise sprite
- favicon add
