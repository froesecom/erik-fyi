<div class="post-content">
  <p> Erik Froese is a software engineer and writer from Melbourne, Australia. He has a <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/erikfroese">doppelganger</a> from New York, who has the same name and is perhaps a better programmer.</p>

    <p>Not sure why you’re still here, but you’re probably either my mom or a recruiter. Mom, things are good. Thanks for checking in. Recruiter, other Erik lives in Brooklyn.</p>

   <p>If you’ve gotten to this paragraph, well done. I’m guessing you’re older because nobody reads this much anymore. I like reading too. For a long time, I was employed as a long-form magazine writer.</p>

   <p>“A writer!” I hear you say? “Didn’t you just change from third-person to first-person in the space of 60 words?” Good catch. I said I was a writer, not an editor. For what it's worth, I have been nominated for a few writing awards. Check out my <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.linkedin_url }}">LinkedIn account</a> for more. Or don’t.</p>

   <p>Then I became a programmer, and now you’re like, “That makes no sense”. I’ll tell you what makes no sense: pessimism. I'm open to new things and I like learning. I was a straight(-ish)-A, university-level math and physics student. I'm into science and philosophy and technology, and it all goes together like pecan pie, which is an underrated dessert.</p>
   <p>As far as programming is concerned, I work full-stack and understand infrastructure, both cloud and on-premise. I write JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Elixer, some C, whatever you got. I have years of experience with front-end frameworks including React, Angular, and Ember (gasp!). Look, I'm no Alan Turing, but I call myself a professional and I think people like working with me.</p>
     <p>Okay, well. Bye.</p>
