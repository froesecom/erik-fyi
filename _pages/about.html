  <p> Erik Froese is a web developer and writer from Melbourne, Australia. He has a <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/erikfroese">doppelganger</a> from New York, who has the same name and is perhaps a better programmer. Other Erik seems like a cool guy. You should check him out instead.</p>

    <p>Not sure why you’re still here, but you’re probably either my mom or a recruiter. Mom, things are good. Thanks for checking in. Recruiter, you’ve got the wrong Erik. Other Erik lives in Brooklyn.</p>  

   <p>If you’ve gotten to this paragraph, well done. I’m guessing you’re older. Nobody reads this much anymore. I like reading too dude, it’s cool. I used to be a magazine writer… a long-form magazine writer. Like 3000 words long. So yeah, I can read and write long stuff for realz. Anyway, that industry is a mess now, although I still like to read me a magazine from time to time.</p> 

   <p>“A writer!” I hear you say? “Didn’t you just change from third-person to first-person in the space of 60 words?” That’s how I roll guys. I don’t even give a fuck. I said I was a writer, not an editor. Without editors like  <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Youngblut">this</a> I’d have just been another wanker writing scripts for adult chat lines. (I actually did that in 2004. $75 a script. It was awful, awful money.) Instead I went on to nearly win a bunch of writing awards in Canada. Peep my <a target="_blank" href="{{ site.linkedin_url }}">LinkedIn account</a> for the deets. Or don’t.</p> 

   <p>Then I became a programmer, and now you’re like, “That makes no sense”. I’ll tell you what makes no sense, that negative attitude you’ve got. Open your mind to the unexpected my friend. I was a mother truckin’ scientist long before I was a writer. I was a straight(-ish)-A, university-level math and physics student. Then I spent a year killing mice in a lab. Killing mice doesn’t really have anything to do with programming, but math does. Sometimes I have nightmares about little ghost rodents crawling around in my bed. “Why did you do it?”, they whisper in my ear. “Why?” Now you see why I’m not a scientist anymore.</p> 
   <p>As far as programming goes, I mainly use Ruby (Rails) and JavaScript. I have experience with Ember, but I probably wouldn't use it again, unless someone convinced me to. I'm a push-over like that. I've dabbled with Elixir and that seems cool. It's what all the hipster Ruby devs are doing these days. Look, I'm no Alan Turing, but I call myself a professional and I think people like working with me for the most part.</p>
     <p>Okay, well. Bye.</p>
